Eyelid removal
- in original space or in polar space?
- k means clustering?
	- nope, mean shift
	- k means will force clustering
	- clustering is unprobable
	- grascale morphology, filtering, THEN clustering


Convolve the 1 D profile of the arc of the iris
with the derivative of the gaussian

To find the discontinuity

like running canny on the outer contour of the iris 
(1st part) derrivative of gaussian = optimal edge deteection filter

Area under ROC curve

shuffle the images
