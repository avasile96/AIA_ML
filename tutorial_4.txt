How to tune networks?

How to use Gabor?
- gamma, (phase shift - psi?) not meaningful
- sinusoidal with weights generated by gaussian
- 5x8 (five scales and 8 orientations)
- gabor filter optimized for everything but gamma, psi
- wavelength
- theta --> measuring the angle of the normal (shoud be 90deg)
- gamma 1
- psi 0
- frequency sqrt(2) -> pixel wavelength?
- stdev of the whole image
- tiling --> one 
- iris code: phase contains most of the information
- magnitude is influenced by intensity
- DC component: average intensity (we don;t want this, intensity invariance!)
- phase: quantization approach: 4 quadrants coded with 2 bits
==> 2 bits for each feature map
- 8 tiles per feature map
- 16 feature maps
- 2 bits for 4 quadrante ==> 256 bits
- Daugman paper
- PCA for feature dimensionality reduction
- grayscale morphology

======================================================
- PCA (Flatten) to use this
- and unflatten afterwards
- starting from 32 channels would be too much
