1. UNet works perfectly, but would it be a good idea to overfit it to this dataset?
We know it's unethical but for the purpouses of this project, it owuld be best?

2. Is this polar transformation good enough or should we get rid of the black?

3. Besides Gabor & Harr do you have any other suggestions?

4. Does the rule of thumb for number of features still apply with 10 images/patient?

5. Any suggestions for Multiclass Cassifiers? I know SVMs work best for binary.

6. Dimensionality reduction in feature space?

7. Ensemble methods?

Feature extraction (deep learning):
	Autoencoder for feature extraction
	Clustering technique for classification if features are deep

Smaller the image input, shallower the network

Take papers of iris recognition doing wavelet

Deep Learning for classification (recognition) --> resnet
